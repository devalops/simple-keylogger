### Simple Keylogger
           
### ⚠️ FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY! ⚠️

This project is a simple keylogger written in Python. It captures keystrokes in real time and logs them to a .win file. The purpose of the weird file extension is to confuse the victim, in case the file is discovered. The file contains text only. The goal of this project is to demonstrate how keylogging works and to raise awareness about potential security vulnerabilities.

### 💡NOTE: Press insert key to stop the program 💡

I have tried to use a key that is not used by many users in day-to-day life. You can specify a different key in the ```release(key)``` function.

### 🎀 Installation 🎀

Install the following libraries before continuing:

```python
pip install pynput
```
### 🎀 Features 🎀

* Runs silently in the background
* Sanitizes user input to make it look "pretty"
* Automatically creates and appends to a "WIN" file
